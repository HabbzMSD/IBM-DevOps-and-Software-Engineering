# Introduction to Agile and Scrum

__Introduction to Agile Philosophy__

- Agile is an iterative approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, interactivity, and transparency using small, cross-functional teams

- The Agile Manifesto describes the core values of Agile:

    - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

    - Working software over comprehensive documentation

    - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

    - Responding to change over following a plan

- The waterfall approach is a structured, step-by-step process that can lead to problems not surfaced until later in development

- Extreme Programming (XP) advocated an iterative approach that valued simplicity, communication, feedback, respect, and courage 

- A Kanban system is characterized by visualizing workflow, limiting work in progress, managing and enhancing flow, making process policies explicit, and continuously improving a process

- Working in small batches means delivering something useful quickly

- An MVP is the cheapest/easiest thing you can do to test a hypothesis and learn 

- Behavior Driven Development makes sure you are building the right thing

- Test Driven Development makes sure you are building the thing right

- Pair programming enables you to discover defects earlier and increase your code quality

- The Gherkin syntax, which comes from a company called Cucumber, is a single syntax that developers and stakeholders can understand: given some set of preconditions, when an event occurs, then some outcome is observed.

__Introduction to Scrum Methodology__

- Scrum is a methodology that follows the Agile philosophy

- The Scrum management framework:

    - Provides structure through defined roles, meetings, rules, and artifacts

    - Prescribes small, cross-functional, self-organizing teams

    - Uses fixed-length iterations called sprints

    - Produces a potentially shippable product increment with every iteration

- The product owner represents stakeholders, articulates the product vision, and decides priorities, requirements, and readiness to ship

- The scrum master coaches the team, promotes a cooperative environment, shields the team from interference, and unblocks impediments

- The scrum team is small, dedicated, co-located, cross-functional, and self-managing

- The scrum team negotiates commitments with the product owner — one sprint at a time

- The scrum team has autonomy regarding how to reach commitments

- Scrum produces a product backlog, a sprint backlog, and a completed — or done — increment

- The Scrum events are sprint planning, daily Scrum meetings, sprints, sprint reviews, and sprint retrospectives

- If done well, Scrum can: 

- Increase employee productivity and happiness

- Improve product quality

- Reduce time to market

- Enhance stakeholder satisfaction

__Organizing for Success__

- How you are organized can affect the systems that you build. 

- Giving teams autonomy leads to motivated teams who can execute faster and build better systems 

- Not adopting Agile across your organization can lead to operational bottlenecks

- Many companies adhere to their waterfall planning and call it Agile

- Simply doing iterative development is not Agile unless you are being responsive to changes and delivering value often
