# Working DevOps

- Taylorism was designed for factory work and software development is bespoke, that is, more like craftwork, and that working in silos leads to mistakes and bottlenecks. 

- Team ownership and stable teams make software development more like product development rather than project management. 

- Developers want innovation, while Operations want stability. 

- Required DevOps behaviors include shared ownership, collaboration, embracing change, and data-driven responses. 

- Infrastructure as Code is describing infrastructure in a textual executable format. 

- Ephemeral infrastructure can be used and then discarded because servers are built on demand, via automation, using Infrastructure as Code techniques. 

- Continuous Integration is building, testing, and integrating every developer change into the master branch after tests have passed. 

- The benefits of Continuous Integration include faster reaction time, moving faster, and reducing the risk in integrating code. 

- Continuous Delivery ensures that code can be rapidly and safely deployed to production by delivering every change to a production-like environment. 

- The five principles of Continuous Delivery have to do with quality, working in small batches, automation, continuous improvement, and shared responsibility.
