# Measuring DevOps

- Measure and reward what you want to improve.  

- People seek information on what is rewarded and then seek to do that. 

- Measuring social metrics leads to improved teamwork and measuring DevOps metrics allows you to see the progression toward your goals. 

- If you want people to be social, then measure them being social. 

- DevOps changes the objective of problem resolution from failure prevention to failure recovery. 

- Vanity metrics may be appealing at first but offer limited actionable insights. 

- Actionable metrics provide meaningful ways to measure your processes and take action toward goals. 

- DevOps actionable metrics include mean lead time, release frequency, change failure rate, and mean time to recovery. 

- You can rate statements developed by Dr. Nicole Forsgren to measure your team’s culture, including statements about information, failures, collaboration, and new ideas. 

- Mean lead time is the measure of how long it takes for an idea to get to production. 

- Change failure rate is the rate of failure from pushing new releases out. 

- Mean time to recovery is how long it takes to recover from a failure. 

- Failures are learning opportunities that should not be punished. 

- Dr. Nicole Forsgren developed cultural statements for measuring team culture.
