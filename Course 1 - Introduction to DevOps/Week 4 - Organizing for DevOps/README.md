# Organizing for DevOps

- Organizations need to have small, dedicated, cross-functional, self-organizing teams to successfully implement DevOps. 

- Conway’s Law implies that a company’s design results are a direct reflection of the company’s communication structure. 

- Instead of the traditional structure organized around technology, successful DevOps teams should be organized around business domains. Each team should have its own mission that aligns with a business domain. 

- DevOps is a mindset that the whole organization adopts. 

- DevOps solves problems caused by siloed teams. 

- DevOps is the practice of development and operations engineers working together during the entire software lifecycle, following lean and Agile principles that allow them to deliver high-quality results. 

- Actions without consequences can lead to apathy. 

- Allowing teams to feel the effect of their actions fosters empathy, resulting in higher-quality work. 

- The organizational objective of DevOps is to attain a shared mindset and empower everyone to deliver customer value.
