# Overview of Cloud Computing

__Introduction to Cloud Computing__

- Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing resources over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis; resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned among multiple users and scale up and down in response to users’ needs. 

- The origins of cloud computing can be traced back to the mainframes of the 1950s, with virtualization technologies and hypervisors serving as catalysts for the emergence of modern-day cloud computing.

- Organizations must consider their business needs, investment viability, and risk capacity in order to create a cloud adoption strategy that delivers desired benefits without causing business disruptions and security, compliance, or performance issues.

- Cloud adoption is growing faster than predicted. Driving this technological wave are cloud service providers with a host of services ranging from Infrastructure, Platform, and Software services. Some major Cloud providers of our times include AWS, Alibaba Cloud, Google, IBM, and Microsoft Azure. 

__Business Case for Cloud Computing__

The adoption of cloud technologies is enabling enterprises, big and small, to be agile, innovative, and competitive, and to create differentiated customer experiences. The question organizations are asking is not whether they should move to the cloud, rather what strategy they should adopt to move to the cloud. 

Some case studies that demonstrate the impact businesses have created by adopting cloud:

- American Airlines adopting cloud technologies to deliver customer value rapidly across its enterprise 

- UBank leveraging cloud platform services to give more control to their developers thereby removing barriers to innovation

- Bitly leveraging the scalability offered by cloud infrastructure for low-latency delivery to its geographically disbursed enterprise customers

- ActivTrades leveraging the infrastructure, storage, network, and security offerings on the cloud to accelerate execution and delivery of new functions in their online trading systems to their customers 

__Emerging Technologies Accelerated by Cloud__

Emerging technologies, powered by the cloud, are disrupting existing business models and creating unprecedented opportunities for businesses to grow, innovate, and create value for their customers.

Some case studies that demonstrate how the use of emerging technologies on the cloud is creating value for millions around the world:
